      "description": "These four-ingredient salmon nuggets are crispy, gluten-free, filled with flavor and so healthy. They are like my miracle nugget, and especially great if you are pescatarian but just craving a *hit* of fast-food flavor. C’mon, we all need it every now and then! These salmon nuggets are easy to make, they take minutes to assemble and then all they need to do is get all crispy in the oven. I love making these with wild sockeye salmon to keep them extra healthy, but they will work with any variety of salmon you have access to!",
