# Recipe Collection 

The initial conceit of this app was to be a place to store information for my back log of recipes while getting myself some experience using React.

I'm hoping that it can at least serve that purpose at the lowest level. 

I'm trying to keep the scope of this somewhat limited in the beginning. 
I can feel it growing in my mind quite quickly honestly, much quicker than I'll be able to implement all of the features I might want it to have. 

So for now I'm going to implement these ***basic*** features. 

Elements: 
- Pages
    - [ ] HomePage
    - [ ] RecipePage
        - If the data coming through can I have this page act as the "Add" page
    - [ ] Search
Components
- [ ] Recipes
- [ ] Recipe

Features (sorted by page): 
- Recipes
    - CRUD Functions
        - [ ] View
        - [ ] Edit
        - [ ] Delete
        - [ ] Save 
    -  
- Search
    - [ ] Chefs
    - [ ] Books
    - [ ] Websites
    - [ ] Ingredients
    - [ ] Season
